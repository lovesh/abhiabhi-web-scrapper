# README #
My first python project. Web scrapper and comparator for few ecommerce sites that i was scraping to create a price comparison site abhiabhi.com. The site is dead now. Also most of the scrappers here wont work because the layout of the sites have changed since then. Also there is just one commit as i didnt know any source control system back then

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.
